# emotion-detection-for-openpose
This notebook is a demo algorithm that detects 3 emotions ("I don't know", "happy/celebrting" and "thinking") from a .csv file created by openpose algorithm.

The output is the number of frames and time of each emotion occurrence. 

.csv files in the folder are examples that I recorded and used to write the code and check its performance. In the Jupiter Notebook, the .csv file that is read could be changed at the function call at the last field.
